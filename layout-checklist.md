# Layout review checklist

## General

* [ ] [Schematic review](schematic-checklist.md) complete and signed off, including pin swaps done during layout
* [ ] Layout DRC 100% clean

## Decoupling

* [ ] Decoupling caps as close to power pins as possible
* [ ] Low inductance mounting used for decoupling (prefer ViP if available, otherwise "[]8" shaped side vias

## DFM / yield enhancement

* [ ] All design rules within manufacturer's capability
* [ ] Minimize use of vias/traces that push fab limits
* [ ] Controlled impedance specified in fab notes if applicable
* [ ] Confirm impedance calculations include soldermask, or mask removed from RF traces
* [ ] Stackup verified with manufacturer and specified in fab notes
* [ ] Board finish specified in fab notes
* [ ] If panelizing, add panel location indicators for identifying location-specific reflow issues
* [ ] (recommended) Layer number markers specified to ensure correct assembly
* [ ] Fiducials present (on both sides of board) if targeting automated assembly
* [ ] Fiducial pattern asymmetric to detect rotated or flipped boards
* [ ] Soldermask/copper clearance on fiducials respected
* [ ] Panelization specified if required

## Footprints

* [ ] Confirm components are available in the selected package
* [ ] Confirm components (especially connectors and power regulators) are capable of desired current in the selected package
* [ ] Verify schematic symbol matches the selected package
* [ ] Confirm pinout diagram is from top vs bottom of package
* [ ] (recommended) PCB printed 1:1 on paper and checked against physical parts
* [ ] 3D models obtained (if available) and checked against footprints
* [ ] Soldermask apertures on all SMT lands and PTH pads

## Differential pairs
* [ ] Routed differentially
* [ ] Skew matched
* [ ] Correct clearance to non-coupled nets

## High-speed signals

* [ ] Sufficient clearance to potential aggressors
* [ ] Length matched if required
* [ ] Minimize crossing reference plane splits/slots or changing layers, use caps/stitching vias if unavoidable
* [ ] Confirm fab can do copper to edge of PCB for edge launch connectors
* [ ] Double-check pad width on connectors and add plane cutouts if needed to minimize impedance discontinuities

## Power
* [ ] Minimal slots in planes from via antipads
* [ ] Sufficient width for planes/traces for required current


## Sensitive analog
* [ ] Guard ring / EMI cages provided if needed
* [ ] Physically separated from high current SMPS or other noise sources
* [ ] Consider microphone effect on MLCCs if near strong sound sources
* [ ] Feedback track for resitive divider for power converter IC routed after the last filter capacitor. Avoid routing from the Inductor pad connected at SW node of the IC which also has same net name as the last filter capacitor.


## Mechanical
* [ ] Confirm all connectors to other systems comply with the appropriate mechanical standard (connector orientation, key position, etc)
* [ ] LEDs, buttons, and other UI elements on outward-facing side of board
* [ ] Keep-outs around PCB perimeter, card guides, panelization mouse-bites, etc respected
* [ ] Stress-sensitive components (MLCC) sufficiently clear from V-score or mouse bite locations, and oriented to reduce
bending stress
* [ ] Clearance around large ICs for heatsinks/fans if required
* [ ] Clearance around pluggable connectors for mating cable/connector
* [ ] Clearance around mounting holes for screws
* [ ] Plane keepouts and clearance provided for shielded connectors, magnetics, etc
* [ ] Confirm PCB dimensions and mounting hole size/placement against enclosure or card rack design
* [ ] Verify mounting hole connection/isolation
* [ ] Components not physically overlapping/colliding
* [ ] Clearance provided around solder-in test points for probe tips

## Thermal

* [ ] Thermal reliefs used for plane connections (unless via is used for heatsinking)
* [ ] Solid connections used to planes if heatsinking
* [ ] Ensure thermal balance on SMT chip components to minimize risk of tombstoning

## Solder paste

* [ ] No uncapped vias in pads (except low-power QFNs where some voiding is acceptable)
* [ ] QFN paste prints segmented
* [ ] Small pads 100% size, larger pads reduced to avoid excessive solder volume
* [ ] No paste apertures on card edge connectors or test points

## Solder mask

* [ ] Confirm SMD vs NSMD pad geometry
* [ ] Adequate clearance around pads (typ. 50 um)

## Silkscreen

* [ ] Text size within fab limits
* [ ] Text not overlapping drills or component pads
* [ ] Text removed entirely in, or moved outside of, high component/via density areas
* [ ] Traceability markings (rev, date, name, etc) provided
* [ ] Silkscreen box provided for writing/sticking serial number
* [ ] Text mirrored properly on bottom layer
* [ ] Test points labeled if space permits

## Flex specific
* [ ] Components oriented to reduce bending forces
* [ ] Teardrops on all wire-to-pad connections

## CAM production
* [ ] KiCAD specific: rerun DRC and zone fills before exporting CAM files to ensure proper results
* [ ] Export gerber/drill files at the same time to ensure consistency
* [ ] Visually verify final CAM files to ensure no obvious misalignments
